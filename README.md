**Include justification of design decisions:**
Our subject area is a subscription service that sends you monthly vinyl records. Level of detail can be found through the presentation, and how we make our company and services easy to understand by a simple visit of our website. The expeceted benefits / response we hope to achieve are to create new record fans, and find a perfect algorithm to fit everyone's taste.

**Why your decisions would increase value for a client**
I believe client value is directly correlated with individual uniqueness, since the goal of this company is to only send albums that fit the music taste of the consumer.

**Who was your audience and how the design considers their needs.**
Our intended audience are music fans of all ages, and to encourage a newfound love for the authentic sound that vinyl brings to music of all genres.
